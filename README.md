Our app is a friendly machine learning digital financial assistant.

We want our clients to easily understand their spending habits, thus, introducing charts as alternative to traditional listed transaction history

Data analysis will be performed by an AI, that gets smarter thru machine learning.

The user then receives friendly message or financial advise thru push notification.

Lastly we feature utilization of text-to-speech to make our app more human and also extending mobile banking to people with disabilities.
